Quiz 1
Part 1: recognizing nouns
Identify the gender, case and number, and gender of each noun. If there are multiple possible forms, list all options. Translate prepositional phrases.

1. filiam (feminine, accusative, singular)
2. in coniugium (neuter, nominative/accusative, singular)- (in this case it is accusative due to the preposition) into the marriage
3. animo (masculine, dative/ablative, singular)
4. uirgine (feminine, ablative, singular)
5. parentes (masculine, nominative/accusative, plural) 
6. ad uxorem (feminine, accusative, singular) towards the wife 

Part 2: recognizing verbs
For each of the following verbs, identify the tense, voice, mood, person, and number.
If the form is finite (not an infinitive) and singular, convert to plural; if the form is finite and plural, convert to singular.
peto, petĕre, petivi or petii, petitus: to attack, demand, seek
neco, necare, necavi, necatus: to slay
rogo, rogare, rogavi, rogatus: to ask
coepio, coepĕre, coepi, coeptus: to begin
interficio, interficĕre, interfeci, interfectus: destroy, kill

1. petivisset (pluperfect, active, subjunctive, 3rd person, singular) --> petivissent
2. necauit (perfect, active, indicative, 3rd person, singular) --> necaverunt
3. necari (present, passive, infinitive, 3rd person, singular) ❌
> necari- infinitive, passive, present
5. rogaretur (imperfect, passive, subjunctive, 3rd person, singular) --> rogarentur
6. coepit (present, active, indicative, 3rd person, singular) --> coepiunt 👍 Could also be *perfect*.  What would the plural look like?
7. interfecisset (pluperfect, active, subjunctive, 3rd person, singular) --> interfecissent
8. misit (perfect, active, indicative, 3rd person, singular) --> miserunt

Part 3: Latin composition
Translate (only) the italicized verb forms into Latin. E.g., if you were given “Hercules saw Deianira,” you could translate saw with vidit.
interficio, interficĕre, interfeci, interfectus: destroy, kill
duco, ducĕre, duxi, ductus: to lead
rogo, rogare, rogavi, rogatus: to ask

1. Centaurs are being killed by Hercules. (Use the present tense) - interficĕntur
2. Centaurs were being killed by Hercules. (Use the imperfect tense) - interficebantur ❌
3. Centaurs were killed by Hercules. (Use the perfect tense) - interfecti/interfectae/interfecta sunt  👍 (*centaurus, centauri* is actually always masculine in Latin;  which of your answers would be correct for masculine subject?)
4. When Hercules killed the Centaurs, he carried off Deianira. (Emphasize the circumstance, not the timing, of what Hercules did.) - interfecit ❌
5. At the moment when Deianira saw Hercules’ garment burst into flames, she realized the Centaur had lied to her. - vidit
6. Hercules led Deianira in marriage (i.e., he married her). - duxit
7. Hercules repeatedly asked Eurytus for permission to marry Iole. - rogavit ❌
