Commenting on Latin reading
Option B
Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art. Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginusâ€™ Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

Hyginus Chapter 30 section 2: Leonem Nemeum, quem Luna nutrierat in antro amphistomo atrotum, necauit, cuius pellem pro tegumento habuit.
Translation: He killed the Nemean Lion, who the Moon raised in a cave, and he had hide for armor.

I was looking at an image of artwork by Miguel Coimbra which shows The Nemean Lion wresteling with Hercules before it was killed. I think it really strengthens the idea of how powerful Hercules was for killing the lion as it looks strong and fierce in the artwork. The point in section 3 of Chapter 30 which reveals that Hercules also defeated the Minotaur, further emphasizes the strength og Hercules and his god-like qualities. This is a very common theme for Hercules to be fighting another being, so it makes sense that there is plenty of artwork that displays Hercules as a brave fighter against all different kinds of monsters to paint him in a heroic light.
